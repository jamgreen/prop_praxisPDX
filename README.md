#Property Praxis PDX
This is a project to explore the contours of Portland, OR's property market. Portland is in the middle of a massive property boom as the city continues to grow at a breakneck pace. Like many other cities, though, Portland suffers massive amounts of displacement and increasingly unafforable housing. Low, moderate, and middle income renters and homeowners are all feeling the pressure. But while everyone is aware of the greater changes of the Portland housing market few know *who* the actual players are. Housing markets are often described as collections of individuals bidding against each other-ostensibly small renters and buyers competing for precious space. But Portland's housing market, like many others, is dominated by institutional investors (large banks and hedge funds that have moved into the property business) and a small group of larger landlords that control multiple properties and lots for the sake of speculative profit. Property Praxis PDX is the project to show exactly who the major players are in the Portland housing market.
